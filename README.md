```python
from lendiq import LendIQClient

client = LendIQClient(api_key="liq_live_...")

deal = client.deals.create(business_name="Acme Trucking LLC")
client.documents.upload(deal.id, "statements/chase_jan.pdf")

result = client.deals.get(deal.id)
print(result.recommendation.decision)  # "approved"
```

That PDF just went through Gemini-powered extraction, transaction screening, tamper detection, 12-factor health scoring, and a full underwriting recommendation. Your team didn't write a single rule.

<br />

## Why teams switch to LendIQ

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Before LendIQ
- Manual PDF review (20-40 min per deal)
- Spreadsheet-based scoring
- Inconsistent underwriting criteria
- No tamper detection
- Weeks to onboard new data sources

</td>
<td width="50%">

### After LendIQ
- Automated analysis (seconds per deal)
- 12-factor composite health scoring
- Configurable rulesets with version history
- PDF integrity + tampering detection
- One API call to process any bank statement

</td>

</table>

## LendIQ vs. the alternatives

| | **LendIQ** | Ocrolus | LendAPI | Plaid (Asset Reports) | DIY (in-house) |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Upload PDF &rarr; full underwriting decision | **Yes** | No | Partial | No | Build it yourself |
| Bank statement + tax return + P&L support | **All three** | Statements only | Statements only | No PDFs | Depends on scope |
| Gemini native PDF extraction | **Yes** | Template OCR | Template OCR | N/A | Build it yourself |
| Tamper / fraud detection | **Built in** | Add-on | No | No | Build it yourself |
| Health scoring (12 sub-factors) | **Built in** | No | Basic | No | Build it yourself |
| Underwriting recommendation engine | **Built in** | No | Basic | No | Build it yourself |
| Custom rulesets with version history | **Yes** | No | No | No | Build it yourself |
| MCA position detection | **Yes** | No | No | No | Build it yourself |
| Real-time SSE streaming | **Yes** | Polling | Polling | Polling | Build it yourself |
| Typed SDKs (Python + TypeScript) | **Both** | Python only | None | Multiple | N/A |
| Pricing | **Per document** | Per document | Per document | Per connection | Engineering time |

We don't just extract data from bank statements. We **understand** them — and give you a decision you can act on.

<br />

## Install

```bash
pip install lendiq
```

> Requires Python 3.10+. Only two dependencies: `httpx` and `pydantic`.

<br />

## Sync and async, your choice

Both clients have identical APIs. Pick the one that fits your stack.

```python
# Sync
with LendIQClient(api_key="liq_live_...") as client:
    deals = client.deals.list(status="ready")
```

```python
# Async
from lendiq import AsyncLendIQClient

async with AsyncLendIQClient(api_key="liq_live_...") as client:
    deals = await client.deals.list(status="ready")
```

<br />

## Everything is typed

Every method returns a Pydantic model. Not `dict`. Not `Any`. Real models with real autocompletion.

```python
detail = client.deals.get(deal_id)

# IDE knows every field, every nested object, every type
detail.health.health_score                     # float
detail.health.health_grade                     # str
detail.recommendation.decision                 # "approved" | "conditional" | "declined"
detail.recommendation.risk_factors             # list[str]
detail.recommendation.strengths                # list[str]
detail.financials.avg_monthly_deposits         # float
detail.mca.mca_credit_score                    # float | None

# 12 health sub-factors, individually scored and weighted
for name, factor in detail.health.factors.items():
    print(f"{name}: {factor.score}/{factor.max} (weight: {factor.weight})")
```

All response models are forward-compatible (`extra="allow"`). New API fields are accepted automatically — your code never breaks on deploy.

<br />

## Document intelligence, built in

Upload a PDF and get back structured intelligence — no OCR pipeline, no prompt engineering, no infra to manage.

```python
doc = client.documents.get(doc_id)

# Extraction metadata
doc.extraction_method       # "gemini_native_pdf"
doc.extraction_confidence   # 0.94
doc.document_type           # "bank_statement"

# Tamper detection
doc.integrity.tampering_risk_level  # "clean" | "low" | "medium" | "high"

# Financial analysis (bank statements)
doc.analysis.average_daily_balance   # 16215.30
doc.analysis.total_deposits          # 48920.00
doc.analysis.health_score            # 78.5
doc.analysis.health_grade            # "B"

# Identity verification (driver's licenses)
doc.driver_license_analysis.full_name         # "John Smith"
doc.driver_license_analysis.expiration_date   # "2028-06-15"

# Bank verification (voided checks)
doc.voided_check_analysis.routing_number       # "021000021"
doc.voided_check_analysis.is_voided            # True
```

<br />

## Instant analysis — no account required

Let prospects try LendIQ before they sign up. The instant endpoint processes a PDF in under 2 seconds with no data persistence.

```python
result = client.instant.analyze("statement.pdf")

print(result.summary.total_deposits)        # 284500.00
print(result.summary.total_mca_positions)   # 3
print(result.summary.avg_revenue_quality)   # 0.82

# Per-file breakdown
for file in result.results:
    print(file.bank_name, file.nsf_count, file.mca_daily_obligation)
```

<br />

## Real-time pipeline streaming

Watch documents process in real time. No polling.

```python
for event in client.events.stream(deal_id=deal_id):
    if event.event == "stage":
        print(f"Stage: {event.data}")  # "classifying" → "extracting" → "screening" → "scoring"
    elif event.event == "complete":
        print("Analysis complete")
```

<br />

## Auto-pagination

Forget page math. Iterate over thousands of records with a single loop.

```python
for deal in client.deals.list_all(status="ready"):
    print(deal.business_name, deal.health_grade)
    # Typed as DealSummary — full autocompletion
```

<br />

## Error handling that doesn't suck

Every error is a typed exception with the context you need to debug. No parsing strings.

```python
from lendiq.exceptions import NotFoundError, RateLimitError, ValidationError

try:
    client.deals.get(deal_id)
except NotFoundError:
    # e.status_code == 404
    pass
except RateLimitError as e:
    # e.retry_after — seconds until you can retry
    pass
except ValidationError as e:
    # e.body — full validation error details
    pass
# Every error has e.request_id for instant support correlation
```

<br />

## Webhook verification in one line

```python
from lendiq.webhooks import verify_signature

# HMAC-SHA256 with constant-time comparison. Timing attacks don't apply.
verify_signature(payload=body, signature=headers["X-Webhook-Signature"], secret="whsec_...")
```

<br />

## Built for production

<table>

<tr><td><strong>Idempotency</strong></td><td>Pass an idempotency key on any write. Retry all you want.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Request tracking</strong></td><td>Every request gets a UUID. Every error includes it. <code>client.last_request_id</code> is always available.</td></tr>

<br />

## Configuration

```python
client = LendIQClient(
    api_key="liq_live_...",               # required
    base_url="https://iq.lend.works", # default
    timeout=30.0,                         # default (seconds)
    max_retries=2,                        # default
    logger=logging.getLogger("lendiq"), # optional debug logging
)
```

<br />
